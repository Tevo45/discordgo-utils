# DiscordGo Utilities

This package provides miscellaneous utilities for Discord chatbots that follow the typical `prefixed command â†’ response` paradigm (I just made that up). Everyhing in this repository was written out of necessity, and may not cover your specific use case. If you have some "special needs", or wrote some code that you think would fit here, please fell free to open an issue or pull request.

This README is yet to be further expanded to include features, instalation and examples. But I'm way too lazy to do it now. Oh well...
